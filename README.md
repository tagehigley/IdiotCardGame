# Idiot Card Game
**THIS GAME IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS!**

Thank you for viewing my repo. <br/>
A card game called Idiot.  
Three to five players, everyone but the last one is a winner.

The objective of the game is get rid of all of your cards.
The last player with cards available is the loser of the game.
The game uses a standard deck of 52 player cards.
The game is turned based and not restricted by time.

### Why I built this game
This card game has been played by my family members at family gatherings for as long as I can remember.<br/>
I am a big card game fan and taught all of my friends how to play.<br/>
I previously was required to make a card game in a college course and figured I would take the experience
I gained from that and build my own version of the game that can be played online with friends and family regardless
of where they are in the world.

### Technologies Used

* SignalR is used for server to client communication. <br/>
* .cshtml pages utilizing c# code to speak process user interactions and send data to the server over SignalR
